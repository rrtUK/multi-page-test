## Overview
This temp / test site evaluates whether a procedurally-generated site will correctly put pages into a navbar.
Really a 'pseudo-navbar' b/c it is/was engogenously generated.

## Goal
- show the procedually-generated navbar surfaces the procgen content; and
- assess the ordering, will the pages align/order based on creation date or ordinal-cue aka number on the front

## Other thoughts

test later wi inter-pages
