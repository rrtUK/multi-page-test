## Overview
fourth page, added fifth -- assess whether this appears to the left or right of 5_fifth-page
Was added AFTER 5_fifth-page, determining whether the procedurally-generated jekyll L will place it;
  - to the left of 5_fifth-page (implying ordinal); or 
  - to the right of 5_fifth-page (implying intertemporal)
